## Introduction ##

**MetaProteomeAnalyzer** (MPA) is a software pipeline to analyze and visualize metaproteomics (and also proteomics) data. It consists of a processing server application and a graph-database driven interactive client. 
The metaproteomics data analysis software is developed in the Java programming language and uses a neo4j graph database backend for flexible and user-defined data querying of the results.

## Software Versions ##
# MPA Portable #

**MPA Portable** represents a light-weight and stand-alone software for the identification of proteins and in-depth analysis of metaproteomics (and also proteomics) data. The MPA software uses X!Tandem and OMSSA as search engines and takes MGF spectrum files as input. The server application is included within the application and no SQL database needs to be set up. The user-provided FASTA databases are formatted automatically.
*Please note:* MPA Portable can be run directly on your desktop PC or laptop and no separate installation is needed: just double-click the provided JAR file or use one of the provided batch files.
