## Introduction

**MetaProteomeAnalyzer** (MPA) is a scientific software for analyzing and visualizing metaproteomics (and also proteomics) data. The tool presents a MS/MS spectrum data processing application for protein identification in combination with an user-friendly interactive graphical interface. The metaproteomics data analysis software is developed in the Java programming language and provides various features for an user-defined querying of the results. In addition, MPA can also be executed on the command line (see below).

## Features

The MPA metaproteomics software comes with the following key features:
  * Intuitive graphical user interface
  * Project management for MS/MS experiments
  * Shotgun proteomics data analysis tool
  * Integrates the search algorithms X!Tandem and OMSSA
  * Supports result file from the Mascot search engine  
  * Detailed analysis of taxa, ontologies, pathways and enzymes
  * Grouping of redundant protein hits to so-called "meta-proteins" (protein groups)
  * Label-free quantification methods
  * Interactive overview for each result set
