## Introduction ##

**MetaProteomeAnalyzer** (MPA) is a software pipeline which has been developed for analyzing and visualizing metaproteomics (and also proteomics) data. The tool presents a MS/MS data processing application for protein identification in combination with an user-friendly interactive client. The metaproteomics data analysis software is developed in the Java programming language and uses a neo4j graph database backend for flexible and user-defined data querying of the results.

## MPA Portable ##

**MPA Portable** is a light-weight and stand-alone software for the identification of proteins and in-depth analysis of metaproteomics (and also proteomics) data. The MPA software currently supports the database search engines MS-GF+, X!Tandem and OMSSA taking MGF spectrum files as input. User-provided FASTA databases (preferably downloaded from UniProtKB) are formatted automatically.
*Please note:* MPA Portable can be run directly on your desktop PC or laptop and no separate installation is needed: just double-click the provided JAR file or use the provided batch file (see below on this page).

## Features ##

The MPA metaproteomics software comes with the following key features:
  * Intuitive graphical user interface
  * Project management for MS/MS experiments
  * Shotgun protomics data analysis tool
  * Integrating MS-GF+, X!Tandem and OMSSA search algorithms
  * Detailed analysis of taxa, ontologies, pathways and enzymes
  * Grouping of redundant protein hits to so-called "meta-proteins" (protein groups)
  * Label-free quantification methods
  * Graph database-driven customized querying of results
  * Interactive overview for each result set
  * Portable application

## System Requirements ##
  * **Operating system**: (Tested on Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7)
  * **Memory**: The more memory, the better! (preferably 2 GB at least)

Please [download](http://svn.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/MetaProteomeAnalyzer/Download/mpa-portable-1.2.zip) the latest version of `mpa-portable-X.Y.Z.zip` (where X, Y and Z represent the current version of the software).

Before starting the MPA Portable version, please make sure that you have Java 1.8 installed. To check the currently installed java version, open a console/bash window and type:
```
java â€“version
```

If you haven't installed Java 1.8, please go directly to
[Java.com](http://www.java.com/download/) to download the latest Java version.

## MPA Startup ##
After downloading the zip file, simply unzip the file and use the provided script, i.e. mpa-portable.bat for Windows OS.

You can also double-click on the JAR file, however this will give you no options to change the memory settings (see below).

Another possiblity is to use the commandline directly:
```
java -jar mpa-portable-X.Y.Z.jar -XmxXXXXm 
```
**Note:** -Xmx*XXXX*m stands for maximum assigned memory (in megabytes of RAM)
